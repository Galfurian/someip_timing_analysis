    "# 1 - Estimating the SOME/IP discovery latency\n",
    "This section estimates the discovery latency for a single client/service pair, where the objective is for the client to discover the desired service.\n",
    "Typical scenarios have several services and clients, and the following analysis is a necessary step for handling those scenarios.\n",
    "The idea is that once we compute the discovery time for each client/service pair of the system, the maximum among those values represents the discovery time of our entire system.\n",
    "In the equations used in this section, we will use $c$ to identify the properties of a *client*, $s$ to identify those of a *service*, and $e$ to identify those of a generic *entity*, which can be either be a  *client* or a *service*.\n",
    "Let us now define two variables:\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "    \\tag{1} c_{init} &= c_{\\mathit{BootDel}} +  c_{\\mathit{InitDel}},\\\\\n",
    "    \\tag{2} s_{init} &= s_{\\mathit{BootDel}} +  s_{\\mathit{InitDel}},\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "where $\\mathit{BootDel}$ is the period of time when clients and services are *down*, and $\\mathit{InitDel}$ is the length of their *initial wait phase*.\n",
    "As mentioned above, the delays between messages sent by both client and service during the *repetition phase* is doubled with each consecutive message.\n",
    "We can compute the delay before sending the $i$-th message using the following:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\\tag{3}\n",
    "    d(e, i) = 2^{i} \\cdot e_{\\mathit{RepDel}},\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where $e_{\\mathit{RepDel}}$ represents the repetition delay.\n",
    "The actual size of the *repetition phase* is given by summing all those delays.\n",
    "We can compute its size, up to the $n$-th repetition message, by using the following function:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\\tag{4}\n",
    "    t_{rep}(e, n) = \\sum_{i=0}^{n - 1} d(e, i).\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "Using properties of geometric series, we can transform this sum into a single expression:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\\tag{5}\n",

    "## 1.1 - Computing the actual length of the repetition phase\n",
    "As seen above, the time window when either the client or service starts sending messages is the *repetition phase*.\n",
    "Depending on their respective configuration, we might end up with a service that enters the *repetition phase* before the client, or the other way around.\n",
    "For the purpose of timing analysis, we need to compute the index of the first *find* or *offer* message that is able to reach its destination.\n",
    "To do that, we need to find the timespan in the *repetition phase*, during which the source node (either client or service) sends messages, but the destination node is not ready to receive them.\n",
    "We can call this timespan the *failure window*.\n",
    "However, we need to differentiate between two cases: $z_{s}$ if the client enters the *repetition phase* before the service, and $z_{c}$ if the service enters the *repetition phase* before the client.\n",

    "\\end{cases}.\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "We use $c_{\\mathit{BootDel}}$ instead of $c_{init}$ to compute $z_{c}$ because the client accepts *offer* messages even during the *initial wait phase*.\n",

    "As already mentioned, every message sent inside the *failure window* is not received by the destination node.\n",

    "Applying the $ceil$ function, like we do in Equation (8) and (9), allow us to compute the actual index of the successfully received message, which in the example is $2$.\n",
